Hello there. While this is meant entirely for myself, feel free to use this yourself. I'm on an older version of Vendetta as the latest IPA is bugged, and when the app is refreshed, the native AMOLED theme turns off, partially.

Credits to https://github.com/vorlie for the base theme I customized the colours from. The original was PurpAMOLED: https://github.com/vorlie/VendettaThemes?tab=readme-ov-file#purpamoled
