Hello there. While this is meant entirely for myself, feel free to use this yourself. I'm on an older version of Vendetta as the latest IPA is bugged, and when the app is refreshed, the native AMOLED theme turns off, partially.

To install, copy this link and click the plus sign in the Themes section of Vendetta. As far as I know, it will not prompt to Install Theme on a long press.

Credits to https://github.com/vorlie for the base theme I customized the colours from. The original was PurpAMOLED: https://github.com/vorlie/VendettaThemes?tab=readme-ov-file#purpamoled
